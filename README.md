## Description

Drawer animation in react native. 

## How it works?
Uses `useDrawerProgress` hook to keep track of the progress value when opening/closing the drawer side menu. This value helps in animating the drawer scene wrapper that wraps the screen views.

## Dependencies
- `@react-navigation/native`
- `@react-navigation/drawer`
- `react-native-reanimated`
